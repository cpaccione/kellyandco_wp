                <p>I have worked with Kelly & Company for the last 15 years.  They have been an invaluable strategic advisor as I have built high-performing teams in each of the businesses that I have managed.  They are focused on my success and take the time to understand my business strategy, culture and team dynamics.  With this in mind, they are able to find me the right person at the right time for my business.  Other executive recruiters approach their work as a transactional business.  Kelly & Company approaches it as a strategic necessity.  I would never work with anybody else.</p>
